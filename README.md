<br>This repository contains learning material for the Ph.D.-level course "Applied Statistics and Probability Analysis," taught by [Prof. Fatemeh Jalayer](http://wpage.unina.it/fatemeh.jalayer/index.html) at the University of Naples Federico II.

## Course Overview

This Ph.D.-level course introduces elementary concepts in probability, focusing on the notion of probability as extended logic, as described in E. T. Jaynes' book [Probability Theory: the Logic of Science](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/probability-theory/9CA08E224FF30123304E6D8935CF1A99). The objective is to equip researchers with essential concepts and tools for problem-solving. 

The course covers:

- Elementary concepts in probability theory.
- Different types of probability distributions, including the Poisson family, Normal, and Lognormal distributions.
- Probabilistic model of linear regression.
- Introduction to the standard Monte Carlo Simulation method.

With focusing on the application of probabilistic concepts through real research examples.
