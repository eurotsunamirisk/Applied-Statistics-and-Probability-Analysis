This repository contains learning material for “Applied Statistics and Probability Analysis”, a Ph.D.-level course taught by Prof. Jalayer (http://wpage.unina.it/fatemeh.jalayer/index.html) at at the University of Naples Federico II.

This Ph.D.-level course strives to introduce elementary concepts in probability. The main aspect that distinguishes this course is that it is inspired by the concept of probability as extended logic (see E. T. Jaynes 2003, Probability Theory: the Logic of Science https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/probability-theory/9CA08E224FF30123304E6D8935CF1A99).

The objective of this course is to introduce the essential concepts and tools that a researcher may encounter in his/her problem-solving. The course begins by providing elementary concepts in probability theory. Next, the students are going to get to know the different types of probability distributions and their statistics. Specifically, the Poisson family of distributions, Normal and Lognormal distributions will be discussed thoroughly. Furthermore, the probabilistic model of linear regression will be described. Finally, the standard Monte Carlo Simulation method will be introduced. Emphasis is placed on showing the application of probabilistic concepts in real research examples.
